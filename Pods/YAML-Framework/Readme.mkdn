# YAML.framework for Objective-C

Based on C `LibYAML` library (`http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML`) by Kirill Simonov.
`YAML.framework` provides support for YAML (de/)serialisation similarly to standard `NSPropertyListSerialization`.

It's fast and compatible with iOS.

## Examples

Using input stream:

    NSInputStream *stream = [[NSInputStream alloc] initWithFileAtPath: @"yaml/items.yaml"];
    # or [[NSInputStream alloc] initWithURL: ...]
    
    id yaml = [YAMLSerialization YAMLWithStream: stream
                                        options: kYAMLReadOptionStringScalars
                                          error: nil];
    
    // Dump Objective-C object description
    printf("%s", [[yaml description] UTF8String]);

For input YAML file:

    items:
      - name: Foo
      - name: Bar

Should print dump string similar to:
    
    (
      {
        items = (
          {
            name = Foo;
          },
          {
            name = Bar;
          }
        );
      }
    )
